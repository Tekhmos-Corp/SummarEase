# SummarEase
SummarEase is an application that, using OpenAIs LLM, it generates summaries and also explains stuff in a short way.

## HOW TO USE
### Prerequisites
- PyQt5: Qt5 is a portable framework that can run on various operating systems and helps developers write code without worrying much about the final platform
- OpenAI API: This API allows us to interact with the LLMs developed by the company, OpenAI.
- A valid API key

We have installed them both via pip (python-pip)

### How to run
Set your API key as an os environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY) and then
python main.py
